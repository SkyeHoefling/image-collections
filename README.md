# Test Image Collection
This repository contains a list of locations where you can download collections of images. These images can be used to validate image processing code in your libraries.

## Contributing
If you have a library of images RAW or not that you want to add, please submit a Pull Request.

## Purpose
Writing image processing code is difficult, and even harder if you don't have the correct test data. This repository was built to gather a collection of sites that have useful image libraries to validate image processing code.

## Disclaimer
The sites in this repository each have their own licensing terms, please consult the site owner for use. We take NO RESPONSIBILITY if you use an image from one of the sites without proper permission.
